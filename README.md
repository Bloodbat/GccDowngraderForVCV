# GccDowngraderForVCV
Downgrades MSYS' GCC to allow building VCV Rack dependencies.

---

To use:

- Clone this repository.

- Change to the folder where you cloned it.

- Run `./downgradegcc.sh`

- Press any key to confirm and wait.

- If you want to prevent pacman from updating GCC (and only GCC), run `./preventgccupgrade.sh` and wait.

- You can now build VCV Rack's dependencies **and** update other packages.

Enjoy! -Bloodbat
